# ApacheHttpdSwagger
The latest version of Apache and the Swagger Editor combined in a single package to make working with the Swagger Editor web application easier.  The Swagger Editor is a web application, designed to work in a web browser deployed on a server.  This allows you to quickly and easily create a local server and take advantage of native Swagger features and best practices that are based on http requests for additional Swagger component files.  The is especially helpful and a best practice when Swagger files start to become large and maintenance becomes a more difficult task in real world application of Swagger definition file(s).  Enjoy!  And have a great day!
